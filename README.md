## Project Structure

This project is set up as a monorepo with the following packages:

- `packages/game-time-plus` - The main Next.js application
- `packages/tinybase-server` - WebSocket server for TinyBase synchronization

## TinyBase Implementation

This project uses TinyBase for managing team and player data with both local storage persistence and real-time synchronization. The implementation includes:

- A TinyBase mergeable store for teams and players data
- Local storage persistence for offline capability
- WebSocket synchronization for real-time collaboration
- Custom React hooks for easy integration with components

### Key Files

- `packages/game-time-plus/src/hooks/useTeamsStore.ts` - Custom React hook for using the teams store with local persistence
- `packages/game-time-plus/src/components/Store.tsx` - Provider component for TinyBase store with WebSocket synchronization
- `packages/game-time-plus/src/components/TeamNameForm.tsx` - Example component using the TinyBase store
- `packages/game-time-plus/src/components/Players.tsx` - Component for managing player data
- `packages/tinybase-server/ws-server.ts` - WebSocket server implementation for TinyBase synchronization

### Features

The application demonstrates how to use TinyBase to:

1. Add and delete team names with city information
2. Navigate to team-specific pages
3. Persist data between page refreshes using localStorage
4. Synchronize data in real-time across multiple clients
5. Manage player information for teams

## API

Game Time Plus includes a powerful API for accessing and manipulating team and player data.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables:

```
# TinyBase WebSocket server URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINYBASE_SERVER_URL=ws://localhost:8787
```

An example `.env` file is provided in `packages/game-time-plus/.env.example`.
